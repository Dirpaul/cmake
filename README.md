# for bash script

- What does it do?
Compile and print result.
- What kind of files?
.cpp .h .o
- How it works?
Whether files have been modified or not, 
checks by the time the file was last modified.
The compilation result is saved int the file "out"
Compile make withhelp g++.
Regardless of whether the compilation succeeds or not,
there will always be some output in the files "out".
This can be either the result work of a programm 
or a compiler.
